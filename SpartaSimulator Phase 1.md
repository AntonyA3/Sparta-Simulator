## Due
This project will be submitted to Neil Weightman, by email or on Teams, as a GitHub link on Monday 2022-02-21 at 09:00. In addition, a brief (10 mins max) presentation on the outcome of the project will be made on Friday 2022-02-18 at 16:00 (subject to no other academy presentations being scheduled to conflict with this).

## Overview
You have been asked to build a simulator which will help track the number of people currently training

## Stage 1 requirements:
- The tracker needs to be able to track time in a consistent way
- The program starts by asking how long the simulation will run for
- Every month, a random number of trainees are generated wanting to be trained (50 - 100)
- Every 2 months, Sparta global opens a training centre. They open instantly and can take trainees every month
- A centre can train a max of 100 trainees and takes a random number of trainees every month. (0 - 50 trainees up to their capacity)
- If a centre is full, trainees can be moved to any other centre which is not full
- If all centres are full, the trainees go onto a waiting list. This list must be served first before new trainees are taken
- At the end of the simulation, output should show:
	- number of open centres
	- number of full centres
	- number of trainees currently training
	- number of trainees on the waiting list

## Stage 2 requirements:
These will be made available on 2022-02-15 at 09:30.

## Stage 3 requirements:
These will be made available on 2022-02-16 at 09:30.
